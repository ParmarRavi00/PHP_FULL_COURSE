// 7)  What will be the values of $a and $b after the code below is executed? Explain your answer.
// $a = '1';
// $b = &$a;
// $b = "2$b";


// A) Initial Assignments:

$a = '1';
$b = &$a;

--> $a is assigned the string value '1'.
--> $b is assigned as a reference (&$a), meaning $b now refers to the same variable as $a. Any changes made to $b will affect $a and vice versa. 

// B) Assignment to $b:

$b = "2$b";

--> Here, the right-hand side of the assignment "2$b" means concatenate the string '2' with the current value of $b.
--> At this point, $b contains '1' (because its a reference to $a, which is '1').
--> So, "2$b" evaluates to "21".
--> Therefore, $b is assigned the value '21'.

// C) Effect on $a:

--> Since $b is a reference to $a, any change to $b also affects $a.
--> After $b = "2$b";, $a also gets updated to '21'.


// D) Final Values:

--> After the assignment, both $a and $b hold the value '21'.


Conclusion:

The usage of reference (&$a) in PHP means that modifying $b also modifies $a, as they refer to the same underlying variable.
Therefore, after the concatenation operation "2$b", both $a and $b end up with the value '21'.
